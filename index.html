        <blockquote>
            Muhammad (Arabic: مُحَمَّد, romanized: Muḥammad; English: /moʊˈhɑːməd/; Arabic: [mʊˈħæm.mæd]; c. 570 – 8
            June
            632 CE) was an Arab religious, social, and political leader and the founder of Islam. According to Islamic
            doctrine, he was a prophet divinely inspired to preach and confirm the monotheistic teachings of Adam,
            Abraham,
            Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. He is believed to be the Seal of the Prophets within Islam, with the Quran
            as
            well as his teachings and practices forming the basis for Islamic religious belief.
            Muhammad was born in approximately 570 CE in Mecca. He was the son of Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Amina
            bint Wahb. His father, Abdullah, the son of Quraysh tribal leader Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim, died a few
            months
            before Muhammad's birth. His mother Amina died when he was six, leaving Muhammad an orphan. He was raised
            under
            the care of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, and paternal uncle, Abu Talib. In later years, he would
            periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer. When he was 40,
            circa
            610 CE, Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave and receiving his first revelation from God.
            In 613, Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that "God is One", that
            complete "submission" (islām) to God (Allah) is the right way of life (dīn),[9] and that he was a prophet
            and
            messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in Islam.
            Muhammad's followers were initially few in number, and experienced hostility from Meccan polytheists for 13
            years. To escape ongoing persecution, he sent some of his followers to Abyssinia in 615, before he and his
            followers migrated from Mecca to Medina (then known as Yathrib) later in 622. This event, the Hijra, marks
            the
            beginning of the Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri Calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes
            under
            the Constitution of Medina. In December 629, after eight years of intermittent fighting with Meccan tribes,
            Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca. The conquest went
            largely
            uncontested, and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed. In 632, a few months after returning from
            the
            Farewell Pilgrimage, he fell ill and died. By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had
            converted
            to Islam.
            The revelations (each known as Ayah — literally, "Sign [of God]") that Muhammad reported receiving until his
            death form the verses of the Quran, regarded by Muslims as the verbatim "Word of God" on which the religion
            is
            based. Besides the Quran, Muhammad's teachings and practices (sunnah), found in the Hadith and sira
            (biography)
            literature, are also upheld and used as sources of Islamic law.
